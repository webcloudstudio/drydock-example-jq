# STOP

- stage: initial-build-1
- declared: 2026-08-22T21:17:05Z

## Reason

The build exited 1 with work still on the frontier. Diagnose the failing block from its evidence before rerunning; a score taken over a partial build grades the absence, not the product.

## Clearing

Fix the cause, then delete this file. Every lifecycle stage refuses to run while it
exists, so a run that continues past a halt cannot be produced by accident.
